Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,I keep getting ads for rocket money
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,idk if y'all know what that is
Ramen World,2pm-chats,pandrrr,I do
Ramen World,2pm-chats,pandrrr,The subscription management thing right
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,"It's pretty stupid imo, like who isn't able to keep track of that on their own?"
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,"Maybe I'm the weird one, I obsessively look at my banking and credit statements and if I see anything weird I will immediately try to figure out what it is"
Ramen World,2pm-chats,pandrrr,You‚Äôre not weird for that you‚Äôre responsible lol
Ramen World,2pm-chats,pandrrr,"Also, I can‚Äôt imagine having that many subscriptions"
Ramen World,2pm-chats,pandrrr,Like I think I have maybe 3? 6-7 if I count stuff my parents pay for
Ramen World,2pm-chats,crow_kaw,"I tend to avoid subscriptions where at all possible. I will get a gift card, activate it, then immediately 'cancel' my subscription so it doesn't charge me when it runs out. Just makes the 'forgetting to cancel shit' not affect me"
Ramen World,2pm-chats,pandrrr,^
Ramen World,2pm-chats,krisp_rat,Every once in a while I'll forget I have a subscription active
Ramen World,2pm-chats,krisp_rat,Like I pay for Door dash premium when I'm at school and sometimes over break I'll forget that I have it active.
Ramen World,2pm-chats,krisp_rat,I may or may not have let a more expensive year subscription auto renew once...
Ramen World,2pm-chats,crow_kaw,FORTNITE CREW ‚ÄºÔ∏è
Ramen World,2pm-chats,krisp_rat,There was also that one time I thought that I cancelled fortnite crew (I literally did it right in front of Tyler) and it somehow didn't ??
Ramen World,2pm-chats,krisp_rat,Nah this was instacart+
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,The shit that pisses me off is when services re-enable auto renewal when you're not trying to
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,Like I got 3 free months of NSO with the new Mario Party and I just added it to what I already had and it re-enabled auto renewal
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,I didn't even have an option to not enable it I had to go disable it after activating the free months
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,One time PS+ auto renewed and I called them like two days later
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,"They did in fact cancel it, but for some reason I didn't get the money back"
Ramen World,2pm-chats,krisp_rat,Damn
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,I then tried to contact them multiple times later but their customer service is turbo ass
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,"Eventually I got through to them and they were like ""uhhh yeah talk to your bank buddy"" and then bethpage fixed my problem like immediately üòê"
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,(this was like half a year later bc I'm lazy btw)
Ramen World,2pm-chats,krisp_rat,There was one time where I switched hello Fresh accounts to get the sign up bonus and I thought I cancelled the original account (turns out I didn't). I realized it too late but customer support wouldn't let me cancel one of them before they were delivered so I just told them I never got it  and got a full refund
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,Lying is a great tactic
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,Too bad you're going to **super hell** for lying to hello fresh
Ramen World,2pm-chats,krisp_rat,Nah you need to lie to those people
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,Fair
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,But
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,Super hell.
Ramen World,2pm-chats,lettuce6023,No questions asked

Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,Am I in the minority that I don‚Äôt think the loss of TikTok would be that catastrophic
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,Like there‚Äôs so many clones of it already
Ramen World,politics,getzachd,A new apps is already beginning to replace it on the app store
Ramen World,politics,getzachd,Some definitely chinese app that is likely 10x worse for your data
Expiry's Mateys,Gud intro idea,tempexpiry,oh god
Ramen World,politics,getzachd,,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/773217198415937566/1328851276351668234/IMG_9955.png?ex=678834b1&is=6786e331&hm=1cffa545178e005201cbf1167d9b547692a6a039dccb578fad22e7fc40d0a30c&
Ramen World,politics,getzachd,Top free app by downloads by apple devices
Ramen World,politics,tempexpiry,"i think its hilarious this was done to keep ""data away from them"""
Ramen World,politics,tempexpiry,and we have an  exponentially worse app now
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,Is instagram reels not just the same thing
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,There's a lot of people who are about to lose their income. Tik Tok shop does a LOT of business. Lots of people who don't watch the same things on IG as Tik Tok.
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,Like do you know every person you're subscribed to on YouTube? Would you take the time to go through every person on your subscription list and do that somewhere else?
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,"For me, I‚Äôd say I know like 80%"
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,But that‚Äôs still a fifth of the creators who would lose revenue
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,So I see your point
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,Also did not know much about TikTok shop
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,People can sell and market their products on tik Tok
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,"It's the biggest app on the app store rn. Getting ""rid"" of it is still massive"
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,"I realize it‚Äôs massive, I‚Äôm just wondering if on the consumer side it‚Äôs as big a deal as it‚Äôs being made out to be"
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,Like for creators ofc it‚Äôs gonna be bad
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,But everyday people I really don‚Äôt think will be as affected as they are saying they will be
Ramen World,politics,getzachd,"Massive, you say?"

Ramen World,food-recommendations,getzachd,"The closing manager, of course"
Ramen World,food-recommendations,getzachd,And no you will not be there for $5 burritos
Ramen World,food-recommendations,getzachd,Not if i havw anyrhing to say about it
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,The new app is called red room btw. 100% Chinese owned and a shit ton of censorship obviously.
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,I'm glad one Zach got the reference
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,H*ng K*ng
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,Lmao discord formatting
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,"Zach, unfortunately a lot of those creators are regular people who can make extra money or even their regular job."
Ramen World,food-recommendations,krisp_rat,Might just be me...
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,"The other problem is that like, should the US gov be able to ban an app off the app store like that?"
Ramen World,food-recommendations,getzachd,Nah closing manager is there for reduced price $5 burritos night
Ramen World,politics,tempexpiry,absolutely not
Ramen World,politics,tempexpiry,"yeah this is fucked for a shit ton of creators, plenty use tiktok as main source of revenue and business use for growth/exposure"

Ramen World,food-recommendations,tempexpiry,maybe a lil too late :(
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,I definitely think the overreach component is a little worrisome
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,"Completely understand that, influencers aren‚Äôt all mega millionaires"
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,Just to be clear I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good thing to ban it
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,My point was that the people who are complaining about not being able to see their content that they watch everyday are kinda missing the point
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,"For the non-content creator it isn‚Äôt catastrophic, for everyone else it can have really bad repercussions"
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,"And not for nothing, but data leaking is already an issue with American companies"
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,Banning something doesn‚Äôt fix it
Ramen World,food-recommendations,krisp_rat,We do close at 9pm today. If you want a burrito just lmk.

Ramen World,job-stuff,crow_kaw,This is the person who wears button down shirts backwards btw
Ramen World,job-stuff,crow_kaw,they have not fired her because they think she's autistic

Ramen World,politics,lettuce6023,I don't understand why this is even a priority
Ramen World,politics,lettuce6023,You don't like trans people? Sure fine whatever apparently a lot of people don't. I hope we can agree that there are many much more significant problems our nation is facing
Ramen World,politics,lettuce6023,He's just bigot maxing
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,I swear to fucking god
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,Some small brain cell person wrote that
Ramen World,politics,crow_kaw,This statement makes everyone legally females
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,I don‚Äôt even want to begin to unpack the biological issues with that statement
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,I mean it doesnt say reproductive organs at conception which would make everyone legally a woman.
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,Dan is correct
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,I think it just means that under previous laws a transgender woman would go to a women's correctional facility and vice versa
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,And now you would go to a prison that matched your AGAB

Ramen World,politics,lettuce6023,ok that's not as bad as what I thought
Ramen World,politics,lettuce6023,I don't really know all the intricacies of that topic so I don't have a strong opinion
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,Go to horny jail
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,"It‚Äôs still not good by any means, but he didn‚Äôt make it illegal to be trans"
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,‚Ä¶ yet
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,"I think he's pulling trans people out of the military and he also restricted the gender on official ID's to be just Male and Female. Previously there had been like an X option or something like that. Some states are either preventing people from changing their gender on ID's and in some cases if you had previously changed your gender, when you renew your ID they roll it back"
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,Yeah this is accurate
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,Which is awful for people who are in conflict with their assigned gender
Ramen World,politics,getzachd,All i have to do is be trans and I am exempt from the draft? Lets gooo
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,What are the odds he starts restricting gay rights specifically too?
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,Or be asthmatic!
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,"I mean it'd be pretty hard to pass a law making it ""illegal"" to be trans or something along those lines, but you can get kinda close"
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,They punish the doctors not the actual trans people
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,Very little I think.
Ramen World,politics,pandrrr,That‚Äôs kinda what I thought

Ramen World,exercise-and-sports-reccomendations,krisp_rat,They specifically needed to get back to 1st down to stall again. You can wait like 15- 20 ish seconds before making a play. If they threw the ball they'd risk a turnover. So when they're at 1st down with like 90 ish seconds on the clock they never need to throw the ball and can just wait out the clock.

Ramen World,2am-chats,pandrrr,Wait how much is your deodorant
Ramen World,2am-chats,crow_kaw,I ran out of my supply that lasted me basically a couple years that I bought when they were all on clearance at Rite Aid
Ramen World,2am-chats,crow_kaw,so just now I went to CVS and the average cost for one stick of deodorant is eight dollars
Ramen World,2am-chats,crow_kaw,Like bruh
Ramen World,2am-chats,crow_kaw,don't even get me started on old spice costing $12 for one stick
Ramen World,2am-chats,crow_kaw,"I tend to use speed stick, which is one of the cheaper ones, I think it was six dollars for one stick"
Ramen World,2am-chats,crow_kaw,"I don't wear this shit to smell good, I wear it so I don't smell like a rotting corpse. make cologne expensive, not deodorant."
Ramen World,2am-chats,pandrrr,Cologne being way more expensive than deodorant is a very valid take
Ramen World,politics,krisp_rat,That is pretty funny if true
Ramen World,2am-chats,krisp_rat,Ermmm I literally just got a 5 pack at Costco for $15
Ramen World,2am-chats,crow_kaw,I do not have a costco membershit

Ramen World,2am-chats,pandrrr,But the Costco guys is a separate child and dad right?
Ramen World,2am-chats,lettuce6023,Yeah they're all connected in their shitty little cinematic universe
Ramen World,2am-chats,krisp_rat,Correct
Ramen World,2am-chats,krisp_rat,They're not related at all. Costco son just thought the Rizzler was funny and asked his dad to reach out to him
Ramen World,2am-chats,pandrrr,Wow child thinks another child is funny
Ramen World,2am-chats,krisp_rat,And they do collabs every now and again
